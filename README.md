# Fake Job Posting Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent job postings using machine learning techniques. With the rise of online job platforms, fake job listings have become a serious issue, leading to financial loss and exploitation of job seekers. This model aims to classify job postings as **real or fake** based on textual and structured features.

## Objective
To build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:
- Cleans and preprocesses job posting data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains and evaluates classification models
- Identifies key features contributing to fraudulent listings

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Fake Job Postings Dataset
- Data includes job descriptions, requirements, company information, and labels indicating fraud.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLP techniques (TF-IDF, text preprocessing)

## Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Text Preprocessing and Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training (Baseline & Improved Models)  
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

## Results
The final model demonstrates strong performance in identifying fake job postings while minimizing false positives. Evaluation metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.
